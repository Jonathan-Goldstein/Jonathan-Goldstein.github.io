For this project I was tasked with making a 3 page website.  The site consists a portfolio page, a index/about me page, and a contact page.
In the portfolio page I was tasked with creating linked images that would take the user to websites or links of completed coding projects that I had done.  I had nothing deployable so I instead added placeholder images that will be updated as I complete new coding projects.  
For the index/about me page I was tasked with creating a bio and adding a headshot.  I additionally added a picture of my dog Schnitzel and a paragraph about her, quarantine, and why I decided to take the Penn LPS bootcamp.
I found the contact page the most interesting out of the three pages.   In this page i was asked to creating text boxes where the user could input their name, email and a message 
before clicking a submit button to log the data (which at this point is hypothetical bc it wasn't part of the homework.)  I decided to separate the name text box into two columns 
and have a specific box for the first and last name because I find it more visually appealing.  
Another part of the assignment that I found particularly interesting was creating the navbar and the footer.  I ran into a few issues with the navbar but I was able to debug most
of them in the end.  One such issue was I mistakenly named the portfolio.index link Portfolio.index which caused the Portfolio page to not load and instead show a 404 error.  
It is interesting that all that is needed to prevent a page from loading is mistakenly using an uppercase letter where a lower case letter should be.  The footer while optional
was particularly exciting as I had to use my google fu to learn about the bootstrap icon font-awesome to add a particularly pleasing part of the website for me.  Having the 
linked social media icons on the bottom makes the website makes it look a lot more professional.  I have a long way wo go but this project was a great starter in reinforcing
my knowledge of grids and containers aa well as learning about the structures of bootstrap.  I had difficulties with the css in this project that i'm looking forward to 
remedying as the course goes forward.
