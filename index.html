                          My name is Jonathan Goldstein. I was born in a suburb of Philadelphia called Lower Merion. Upon graduating High School I attended Temple University and moved to Philadelphia during my junior year, where I have lived since, outside of a semester abroad in Rome.  I graduated with a Bachelors degree in History.  While studying in Philadelphia I found a passion for Writing, Photography, Singing and Hillel.  Through these some of these interests I found myself in leadership positions. I joined and co-led two A cappella groups, helped to found the Temple University Gamma Psi Chapter of Sigma Alpha Mu, as well as holding various student leadership positions at both Temple and Penn's Hillel. Upon graduating from College I wrote systems for a local shipping company and then decided to go the self employment route through E-commerce which I have been doing ever since.  Being self employed has taught me many important lessons most important of which is setting my own schedule and a powerful work ethic.  It is with these skills that I am looking forward to learning and implementing full stack web development and moving forward to bigger and brighter opportunities.

                          I am very lucky to have a robust social and family network.  Especially when the Covid-19 Pandemic turned the world upside down.  It has been hard not being able to see loved ones and friends.  So it has been wonderful having a friend to come home to (or now to be at home with) who offers unconditional love for only a few walks a day and some food.  My dog Schnitzel has been a wonderful quarantine companion during these tough times.   

                          When the quarantine went into full effect and I had more time on my hands I realized that I needed a change and decided to invest in myself by taking this Full Stack Development bootcamp.  I am looking forward to more learning, networking, and building friendships with my fellow students in the next 6 months.
